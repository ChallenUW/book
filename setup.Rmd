# Setting Up Your Machine {#setup-machine}

We'll be using a variety of different software programs to write, manage, and execute the code that we write. Unfortunately, one of the most frustrating and confusing barriers to working with code is simply getting your machine properly set up. This chapter aims to provide sufficient information for setting up your machine and troubleshooting the process.

<p class="alert alert-info">Note that iSchool lab machines should have all appropriate software already installed and ready to use.</p>

In short, you'll need to install the following programs: see below for more information / options.

- **Git**: A set of tools for tracking changes to computer code (especially when collaborating with others). This program is already installed on Macs.

    - **GitHub**: A web service for hosting code online. You don't actually need to _install_ anything (GitHub uses `git`), but you'll need to sign up for the service.

- **Bash**: A _command-line interface_ for controlling your computer. `git` is a command-line program so you'll need a command shell to use it. Macs already have a Bash program called _Terminal_. On Windows, installing `git` will also install a Bash shell called _Git Bash_, or you can try the Linux subsystem for Windows 10.

- **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight text editor that supports programming in lots of different languages.

    - You are welcome to use another text editor if you wish; some further suggestions are included.

- **Python**: a general purpose programming language, but one that is often used when working with data. This will be the primary programming language use in this book (though others will be discussed as well). "Installing Python" actually means installing tools that will let your computer understand and run Python code.

    - **Anaconda**: is a _distribution_ of the Python language, which includes a large number of additional add-on packages that we will be using (and can be difficult to install on their own). This is the recommended way of installing Python; we will be assuming that you have installed all of tools provided with the distribution.

The following sections have additional information about the purpose of each component, how to install it, and alternative configurations.


## Git
**`git`** is a version control system that provides a set of commands that allow you to manage changes to written code, particularly when collaborating with other programmers (much more on this in [Chapter 4](#git-basics)). To start, you'll need to [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install the software. If you are on a Mac, `git` should already be installed.

If you are using a Windows machine, this will also install a program called _Git Bash_, which provides a text-based interface for executing commands on your computer. For alternative/additional Windows command-line tools, see below.

### GitHub
GitHub is a website that is used to store copies of computer code that are being managed with `git` (think "Imgur for code"). Students in the INFX 511 course will use GitHub to turn in programming assignments.

In order to use GitHub, you'll need to [create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one. You should register a username that is identifiable as you (e.g., based on your name or your UW NetID). This will make it easier for others to determine who contributed what code, rather than needing to figure out who 'LeetDesigner2099' is. This can be the start of a professional account you may use for the rest of your career!

## Command-line Tools (Bash)
The command-line provides a text-based interface for giving instructions to your computer (much more on this in [Chapter 2](#command-line)). With this book, you'll use the command-line for navigating our computer's file structure, running programs, and executing commands that allows you to keep track of changes to the code we write (i.e., version control with `git`).

In order to use the command-line, you will need to use a **command shell** (also called a _command prompt_). This is a program that provides the interface to type commands into. In particular, we'll be working with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> shell, which provides a particular set of commands common to Mac and Linux machines.

### Command-line on a Mac
On a Mac you'll want to use the built-in app called *Terminal*. You can open Terminal by searching via Spotlight (hit Cmd (`âŒ˜`) and Spacebar together, type in "terminal", then select the app to open it), or by finding it in the `Applications > Utilities` folder.

### Command-line on Windows
On Windows, we recommend using [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which you should have installed along with `git` (above). Open this program to open the command-shell. This works great, since you'll primarily be using the command-line for performing version control.

- Note that Windows does come with its own command-prompt, called the _DOS Prompt_, but it has a different set of commands and features. _Powershell_ is a more powerful version of the DOS prompt if you really want to get into the Windows Management Framework. But Bash is more common for the kinds of computer programming we'll be doing, and so we will be focusing on that set of commands.

Alternatively, the latest updates to Windows 10 (August 2016 or later) _does_ includes a version of an integrated Bash shell. You can access this by [enabling the subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) and then running `bash` in the command prompt.


## Text Editors
In order to produce computer code, you need somewhere to write it (and we don't want to write it in MS Word!) There are a variety of available programs that provide an interface for editing code. A major advantage of these programs is that they provide automatic formatting/coloring for easier interpretation of the code, along with cool features like auto-completion and integration with version control.

There are lots of different coding text editors out there, all of which have slightly different appearances and features. You only need to download and use one of the following programs (we recommend **Visual Studio Code** as a default), but feel free to try out different ones to find something you like (and then evangelize about it to your friends!)

<p class="alert alert-info">Programming involves working with many different file types, each detailed by their extension. It is useful to specify that your computer should show these extensions in the File Explorer or Finder; see instructions [for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/865219/how-to-show-or-hide-file-name-extensions-in-windows-explorer) or [for Mac](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25381?locale=en_US) to enable this.</p>

### Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or VS Code; not to be confused with Visual Studio) is a free, open-source editor developed by Microsoft. While it focuses on web programming and JavaScript, it readily supports lots of languages including Python, and provides a number of [community-built extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) for adding even more features. Although fairly new, it is updated regularly and has has become one of my main editors for programming.

To install VS Code, follow the above link and Click the "Download" button to download the installer (e.g, `.exe`) file, then double-click on that to install the application.

Once you've installed VS Code, the trick to using it effectively is to get comfortable with the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). If you hit `Cmd+Shift+P`, VS Code will open a small window where you can search for whatever you want the editor to do. For example, if you type in `markdown` you can get list of commands related to Markdown files (including the ability to open up a preview).

- While VS Code can handle Python code just fine out of the box, to be most effective when writing code you'll want to add an extension with [additional Python support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python). We recommend [Don Jayamanne's](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python) extension: you can easily install this by using the command-palette (open it up and type `"extension"` to find the "Install Extensions" option). Note that you can disable the pervasive "style warnings" by adding `# pylint: skip-file` to the top of a script file.

For more information about using VS Code, see [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), which includes [videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) if you find them useful. There is also documentation for programming in [Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) specifically.


### Atom
[**Atom**](https://atom.io/) is a text editor built by the folks at GitHub. It is very similar to VS Code in terms of features, but has a somewhat different interface and community. It has a similar command-palette to VS Code, and is arguably even nicer about editing Markdown specifically (its built-in spell-check is a great feature, especially for documents that require lots of written text). This book was authored primarily in Atom.

### Sublime Text
[**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) is a very popular text editor with excellent defaults and a variety of available extensions (though you'll need to manage and install extensions to achieve the functionality offered by other editors out of the box). While the software can be used for free, every 20 or so saves it will prompt you to purchase the full version.

### PyCharm
[**PyCharm(())](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a full-featured Python IDE (integrated development environment) developed by JetBrains. It has more features than you can shake a stick at, including a large number of features that won't be relevant for this book. It is more powerful, but also somewhat "heavier" (read: slower). You would be interested in the _Community Edition_ of the software.

## Python
The primary programming language you will use throughout the book is called **Python**. It's a very powerful, general-purpose programming language that is "friendly" enough that it is often used for information and data sciences. See [Chapter 5](#python-intro) for a more in-depth introduction to the language,

<p class="alert alert-warning">**Important note:** There are two different versions of Python that exist in the world: Python 2 (latest: 2.7) and Python 3 (latest: 3.6). While mostly similar, the newer Python 3 version added [a few basic differences](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) that make it incompatible with Python 2. But a lot of existing programs were slow to change over to Python 3, effectively causing two different versions to exist in active use (kind of like people not switching from Windows XP). Python 3 is considered the "current" version, with Python 2 being "legacy"&mdash;and in fact is now "end of life" and will [not be maintained](https://pythonclock.org/).</p>

In this book you will be working with **Python 3**. Thus you will want to make sure that you _install_ Python 3, and that documentation and examples you reference are _for_ Python 3 (rather than Python 2)!

In order to program with Python, you will need to install the ___Python Interpreter___ on your machine. This is a piece of software that is able to "read" code written in Python and use that code to control your computer, thereby "programming" it.

### Anaconda
There are a number of ways to get Python installed on your machine: in fact, you may have a version (probably Python 2) installed on your computer already! However, the recommended approach for programming for data science is to install [**Anaconda**](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda is a pre-packaged bundle of common Python tools and packages that are commonly used in data science&mdash;many of which we will be utilizing (including [Jupytr](http://jupyter.org/) for running interactive "notebooks", and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for large-scale data work). And the best part: Anaconda makes it easy to get all the pieces installed and ready to use!

To install Anaconda (and Python along with it), simply download the **Python 3.6** installer, run the executable, and follow the instructions. This should install Python and all the required packages.

- On Windows, make sure that you select the option to "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable". This will add a link to to Python that can be found by the command line (it will be on the "path" to applications), and will ensure that you can run Python code from within Git Bash.

    ![Select to add Anaconda to the PATH variable.](img/setup/anaconda-path.png)

- You can confirm that everything is set up correctly by opening the _Command Shell_ you installed above and typing `python --version`. You should see text that looks something like:

    ```
    Python 3.6.1 :: Anaconda 4.3.1 (x86_64)
    ```

    confirming that Python is installed and available.
